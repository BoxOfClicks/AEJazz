//Property, Times, Values, Random, Eases
//Property: Use exact property understood  by after effects and encapsulate with quotes.
//Values: Enclose values in quotes to treat values as offsets rather than absolutes
//Times, Values and Eases - pass as arrays using Square brackets []
//Times: Use 'in' for the inPoint of the layer, 'out' for the outPoint.
//Eases: Set an ease in and an ease out for EACH key frame.
// N.B. To set multiple properties just write a new line
